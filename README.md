# Noire_QoL_change

A personal Cataclysm: Bright Nights mod for various QoL changes. Your experience may vary.

## Currently implemented changes

* Fixed the damage type of "Custom Maid Spear" from the mod "Project Kawaii", changed cut damage to pierce damage to reflect the polearm nature
* Made Advanced UPS, which used plutonium cell, rechargeable in recharging stations
* Added a much less time-consuming recipe to make starch from cattail rhizome with a food processor
* Added recipes to extract acid from disposable batteries
* Added a few vehicle templates for my personal use. The vehicle is not supposed to appear in game without using debug menu
* Buffed Planters

## Dependencies

This mod requires:
* "Project Kawaii"
* "Aftershock"

The vehicle template uses components from "Arcana and Magic Items" mod, but shouldn't affect the game if you don't use debug menu to spawn the vehicle.
